# ~Destitute Dreamscape~
This is a pacifist bullet hell game set in the Touhou universe. Destitute Dreamscape is a fan work that has nothing to do with ZUN or Team Shanghai Alice, the rightsholders of Touhou Project. As far as I am aware, this game fully adheres to the official derivative works guidelines outlined by ZUN for Touhou fan creations.

This game is currently in development and is unfinished.
